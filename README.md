# Senteiment-Analysis-Prototype


🎬🍿 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
A Python-based ML project that predicts whether a movie review is positive (👍) or negative (👎) using supervised learning.

🔍 What it does:
📊 Trains a model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks) on labeled review data.

🤖 Classifies new reviews as positive/negative based on learned patterns.

📈 Evaluates performance with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
🐍 Python + Scikit-learn (or TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning)

📦 NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob (for preprocessing)

📊 Dataset: IMDb reviews or Rotten Tomatoes (labeled data)
